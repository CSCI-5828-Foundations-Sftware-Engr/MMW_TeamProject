## User Story

Link:  https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2635063 

## Web application basic form, reporting
The homepage presents icons which allow users to register, login as well as getting website's basci information.
After the user logs in, the user can search recipes, add recipes to favorite and transfer the recipte to the grocery shopping list.

## Data collection
We initially tried a Kaggle dataset which did not work out because it lacked key information like recipe name. 

We turned to a API called MealDB which allows us to have a huge library of recipes with names, ingredients and images.
